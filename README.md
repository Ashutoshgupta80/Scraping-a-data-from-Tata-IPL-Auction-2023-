# Scraping-a-data-from-Tata-IPL-Auction-2023-
My objective in this project was to extract data from the Tata IPL Auction 2023 website by using a web scraping method. I used a Python library called BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML code of the website and extract the data. I then used Pandas to organize the data into a tabular format. Finally, I displayed the results in a Jupyter notebook.
